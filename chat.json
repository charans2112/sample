    { "sender": "Charan Reddy", "message": "🎉🎂🎈✨ H💖A💖P💖P💖Y B💖I💖R💖T💖H💖D💖A💖Y, SIRI! ✨🎈🎂🎉  

🎊 From strangers ➡️ classmates ➡️ best friends ➡️ my permanent roast target 🔥😂 Who would have thought that the person I barely spoke to in 12th grade would become my go-to partner for nonsense and the official supporter of my arguments (even the ones I’m clearly wrong about 🤭)?  

💌 Siri, you are…
🌸 The most amazing friend 🎀  
😜 The craziest partner-in-crime 🚔  
🫂 The most *questionable* secret-keeper 🤫 (highly sarcastic 😜)  

It’s been exactly **276 days, 10 hours, 6,634 hours, 398,040 minutes, 23,882,400 seconds** since our legendary first meeting in college. The universe took its sweet time, but when it finally threw us together, it was like, ‘Okay, these two HAVE to be best friends now!’ 🤝💥  

From that moment on, BOOM 💥—we built an unbreakable bond filled with:  
💬 Unlimited nonsense convos (95% of which were us roasting each other)  
📞 Endless calls & texts (mostly random but somehow important)  
🎭 Dramatic moments (even though we weren’t the main characters 🤡)  
😂 Countless roasts (mostly me roasting you, but all out of love 💀)  
🫂 Unwavering support (even when I least deserve it, proving you’re the best!)  
😂 Endless laughter over the dumbest things (usually at your expense 😜)  

💌 Things I *reluctantly* appreciate about you:  
✨ You argue like it's a full-time job (and still lose 90% of the time 😏)  
🔥 Your dramatic reactions deserve an Oscar 🏆  
😂 You somehow tolerate my roasting (a rare skill, truly)  
💖 No matter how much I annoy you, you always have my back (why? I still don’t know 😆)  

On your special day, I hope you:  
🎁 Get lots of gifts (and share one with me because I tolerate you 🤭)  
🍰 Eat enough cake to last a lifetime (or at least a week)  
🤑 Receive so much money that you finally pay me back for all the snacks 😆  
🔥 Keep being the chaotic, hilarious legend you are—because life would be boring without you!  

🎂 May your cake be bigger than your patience for me (which isn’t much 🤣)  
🎁 May you get tons of gifts (but remember, sharing is caring 😜)  
💸 May you become so rich that you finally treat me for once 😂  
🥳 May this year bring less stress, more sleep, and fewer reasons to deal with my nonsense (but not too few, I still need someone to roast 😆)  

🎉 H💖A💖P💖P💖Y B💖I💖R💖T💖H💖D💖A💖Y, Siri! 🎉 Enjoy your day, laugh a lot, and remember: you’re stuck with me! 😎🔥 (Enjoy today because the roasting resumes tomorrow 😆)  

🚀 Your No.1 Roasting Rival & Best Friend, Mr. Charan Reddy 😆🔥", "profilePic": "charan.jpg", "date": "2024-02-20T08:20:00" }
