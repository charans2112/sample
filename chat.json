    { "sender": "Charan Reddy", "message": "🎉🎂🎈✨ H💖A💖P💖P💖Y B💖I💖R💖T💖H💖D💖A💖Y, SIRI! ✨🎈🎂🎉  

🎊 From strangers ➡️ classmates ➡️ best friends ➡️ my permanent roast target 🔥😂 Who knew that one day, the person I never spoke to in 12th standard would become my official argument supporter (even when I’m wrong, which is rare 🤭) and my partner in crime for endless nonsense? 🤝😆  

💌 Siri, you are…
🌸 The most amazing friend 🎀
😜 The craziest partner-in-crime 🚔
🫂 The most supportive secret-keeper 🤫 (sarcastically 😜)

Can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that it’s been 276 days, 10 hours, 6634 hours, 398,040 minutes, 23,882,400 seconds since our legendary first meet in college? Where the universe took its time, but when it finally brought us together, finally decided, “Okay, these two HAVE to be best friends now!” 🤝💕

From that moment on, BOOM 💥—we created countless memories, endless gossip sessions, unlimited laughter, and the best of times! 🤭😂💖 No matter how much time passes, our bond remains UNSHAKABLE 💪🔥!, now I can't get rid of you! 😆

And ever since then: 
💬 Unlimited nonsense conversations (95% of which were us roasting each other) 
📞 So many calls & texts (mostly useless but somehow important)  
🎭 So much drama (and we weren’t even the main characters 🤡)  
😂 Countless roasts (mostly me roasting you, but it’s all love! 💀)  
🫂 Endless support (even when I least deserve it, which is why you’re the best!)  
😂 Endless laughter at random things (mostly at your expense 😜)

💌 Things I actually appreciate about you (rare compliments, so cherish them! 🤣):  
✨ You argue with me like it’s a full-time job (and still lose 90% of the time 😏)  
🔥 You always manage to give the most dramatic reactions (Oscar-worthy, truly)  
😂 You somehow tolerate my roasting (which is a skill not everyone has)  
💖 No matter how much I annoy you, you always support me (why? I still don’t know 😆)  

On your special day, I hope you:
🎁 Get lots of gifts (and give me one too, because I deserve it for tolerating you 🤭)
🍰 Eat enough cake to last a lifetime (or at least a week)
🤑 Receive enough money to finally pay me for the party
🔥 Keep being your chaotic, hilarious self—because life would be so boring without you!

Now, for your birthday wishes:  
🎂 May your cake be bigger than your patience for me (which is not much 🤣)  
🎁 May you get tons of gifts (but remember, sharing is caring 😜)  
💸 May you become so rich that you finally buy me snacks instead of the other way around 😂  
🥳 May this year bring less stress, more sleep, and fewer reasons to deal with my nonsense (but not too few, I still need someone to roast 😆)  

🎉 H💖A💖P💖P💖Y B💖I💖R💖T💖H💖D💖A💖Y, Siri! 🎉 Enjoy your day, laugh a lot, and remember: I’m still your best friend, so you’re stuck with me! 😎🔥 (Enjoy your day before I go back to roasting you tomorrow 😆)

🚀 Your No.1 Roasting Rival & Best Friend, Mr. Charan Reddy 😆🔥", "profilePic": "charan.jpg", "date": "2024-02-20T08:42:00" }
